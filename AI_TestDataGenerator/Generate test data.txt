Generate two linked datasets with synthetic data, 100+ entries each with C#.  Use Bogus for this.
Store generated test data in separate files in CSV format. 

The structure of the data should as follows:

Titles : {
title: String,
description: String,
release_year: Integer,
age_certification: String,
runtime: Integer,
genres: String,
production_country: String,
seasons: Integer
}

Credits: {
id: Integer,
title_id: Integer,
real_name: varchar,
character_name: varchar,
role: varchar
}

The relation is one to many Titles -> Credits respectively.

Here is additional data for the rules of the fields:

titles.id numeric title identifier 
titles.title textual movie (series) name 
titles.description textual title description 
titles.release_year should have a Common Era year format 
titles.age_certification should be one of these: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA 
titles.runtime should be a common title duration in minutes 
titles.genres should contain a list of strings representing various movie (series) genres 
titles.production_country should represent a country in ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code 
titles.seasons should represent the number of seasons for series or be empty for movies 
credits.id numeric credits identifier 
credits.title_id corresponding title id 
credits.real_name full credits member name 
credits.character_name corresponding movie (series) character name 
credits.role should represent corresponding role and be one of these: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer

The generated test data should cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive, negative, and edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing of the application's functionality. 

The test data should accurately represent the expected input and output data types, formats, and values, ensuring that it is suitable for validating the application's functionality. 

The test data should be diverse and include different combinations of inputs, ensuring that the application is tested against a variety of scenarios.

Sure, I can provide you with the Bogus-based C# code for creating the requested synthetic datasets. Note that I won't be able to run this code and generate the data here, but you can run it on your machine.

Please install the Bogus and CsvHelper packages in your .NET project. You can do this using the NuGet Package Manager or by running the following commands in your Package Manager Console:

csharp
Copy code
Install-Package Bogus
Install-Package CsvHelper
Next, implement the following code:

csharp
Copy code
using Bogus;
using CsvHelper;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Globalization;

public class Title
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
    public string AgeCertification { get; set; }
    public int Runtime { get; set; }
    public string Genres { get; set; }
    public string ProductionCountry { get; set; }
    public int? Seasons { get; set; }
}

public class Credit
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int TitleId { get; set; }
    public string RealName { get; set; }
    public string CharacterName { get; set; }
    public string Role { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[] AgeCertifications = { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
        string[] Roles = { "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", "Costume Designer", "Music Composer" };

        var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
            .RuleFor(t => t.Name, f => f.Lorem.Word())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Description, f => f.Lorem.Sentence())
            .RuleFor(t => t.ReleaseYear, f => f.Random.Int(1900, DateTime.Now.Year))
            .RuleFor(t => t.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(AgeCertifications))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Runtime, f => f.Random.Int(30, 240))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Genres, f => string.Join(", ", f.Lorem.Words(f.Random.Int(1, 5))))
            .RuleFor(t => t.ProductionCountry, f => f.Address.CountryCode())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Seasons, f => f.Random.Int(1, 20));

        var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
            .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
            .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 99)) // assuming that the IDs of titles start at 0 and go up to 99
            .RuleFor(c => c.RealName, f => f.Name.FullName())
            .RuleFor(c => c.CharacterName, f => f.Name.FullName())
            .RuleFor(c => c.Role, f => f.PickRandom(Roles));

        List<Title> titles = titlesFaker.Generate(100);
        List<Credit> credits = creditsFaker.Generate(500); // assuming an average of 5 credits per title

        using (var writer = new StreamWriter("titles.csv"))
        using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
        {
            csv.WriteRecords(titles);
        }

        using (var writer = new StreamWriter("credits.csv"))
        using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
        {
            csv.WriteRecords(credits);
        }
    }
}
The above C# script creates synthetic data based on the given instructions and writes it into two CSV files: titles.csv and credits.csv. Note that Bogus creates random data, and some entries may not make real-world sense (like an unexpected genre name). You may need to adjust this script to better suit your specific needs.

Make sure to validate your data generation logic and inspect generated data manually before using it for testing. Remember to set appropriate directory paths if you're not running this in the project's root directory.

CsvWriter is not found in packe CsvHelper
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. In the CsvHelper package, the CsvWriter class is inside the CsvHelper namespace. We use the CsvWriter class along with a TextWriter or StreamWriter. Here is the corrected code snippet:

csharp
Copy code
using Bogus;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using CsvHelper;
using System.Globalization;

public class Title
{
    //...
}

public class Credit
{
    //...
}

public class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[] AgeCertifications = { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
        string[] Roles = { "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", "Costume Designer", "Music Composer" };

        var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            //...
            
        var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
            //...

        List<Title> titles = titlesFaker.Generate(100);
        List<Credit> credits = creditsFaker.Generate(500); // assuming an average of 5 credits per title

        using (var writer = new StreamWriter("titles.csv"))
        {
            var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
            csv.WriteRecords(titles);
        }

        using (var writer = new StreamWriter("credits.csv"))
        {
            var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
            csv.WriteRecords(credits);
        }
    }
}
You can use the StreamWriter to open the file you want to write to and then pass that StreamWriter to the CsvWriter. The CsvWriter will use the StreamWriter to write to the file. This is how the CsvHelper library is designed to be used.

Again, I apologize for the confusion and thank you for pointing it out. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.





User
where is it going to store the files?
ChatGPT
The code will store the titles.csv and credits.csv files in the same directory where the application is running.

If you want to specify a different directory, you can provide a full path to the StreamWriter. For example:

csharp
Copy code
using (var writer = new StreamWriter(@"C:\SomeDirectory\titles.csv"))
{
    var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    csv.WriteRecords(titles);
}

using (var writer = new StreamWriter(@"C:\SomeDirectory\credits.csv"))
{
    var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    csv.WriteRecords(credits);
}
This will store the titles.csv and credits.csv files in the C:\SomeDirectory\ directory. Please replace C:\SomeDirectory\ with the actual directory path where you want to store the files.

Remember that your application must have the necessary permissions to write files to the specified directory. If the application doesn't have write permissions, you will receive an exception.





User
After I run the program, I got a message Process finished with exit code 0.
ChatGPT
The message "Process finished with exit code 0" means that your program has completed successfully without any errors.

You can now navigate to the directory where the files titles.csv and credits.csv should have been created to verify the files exist and check the data inside them. By default, the directory is the same where your application is running from.

If you have used a specific directory path while creating the StreamWriter, navigate to that directory to find your files:

csharp
Copy code
using (var writer = new StreamWriter(@"C:\SomeDirectory\titles.csv"))
In the





User
there are no files generated by the code you wrote
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. There might be a misunderstanding regarding the location of the generated files. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

Verify the file path: If you've specified a particular file path in the StreamWriter construction (like new StreamWriter(@"C:\SomeDirectory\titles.csv")), please make sure to check in that location for the files.

Check the working directory: If you did not specify a full path, the files should be in the project's working directory. If you're running this from an IDE like Visual Studio, the working directory is typically the bin\Debug\netcoreappX.X or bin\Release\netcoreappX.X directory within the project directory, where X.X is your target framework version.

Search for the files: You can also search your whole computer for the files titles.csv and credits.csv.

Check for exceptions: Make sure your program is not throwing any exceptions which could prevent the files from being written. If the program is running without errors, it should be creating the files as expected.

Run the program outside the IDE: Sometimes, IDEs can have specific configurations that affect file I/O operations. Try running your compiled .exe directly from the command line or Windows Explorer.

If none of these steps help, it's possible there's a code issue we need to investigate. If you're still having trouble, please share any error messages or additional context and I'll do my best to help.





User
var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)

this should start from 1
ChatGPT
I apologize for the misunderstanding. By default, the UniqueIndex property in Bogus starts from 0. However, if you'd like it to start from 1, you can use the f.UniqueIndex + 1 approach. Here's how you can update your titlesFaker and creditsFaker definitions:

csharp
Copy code
var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
    .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex + 1)
    .RuleFor(t => t.Name, f => f.Lorem.Word())
    // other rules...

var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
    .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex + 1)
    .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(1, 100)) // assuming that the IDs of titles start at 1 and go up to 100
    // other rules...
This way, your Id fields will start from 1, and the TitleId field in the credits will also correctly refer to the IDs in the titles. I apologize for the oversight, and I hope this helps!





User
without specifying a file path, the files are not generated
ChatGPT
I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble generating the files. Let's try specifying a path. Here's a simple way to do this:

Identify a location on your local machine where you'd like to generate these files.

Use the full path of that location in the StreamWriter.

Here's an example if you wanted to save the files to your desktop (assuming it's a Windows machine):

csharp
Copy code
using (var writer = new StreamWriter(@"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\titles.csv"))
{
    var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
   




User
I dont want to specify a path, I want the files generated on the current directory, but it doesn't work
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. When running a .NET application without specifying a full path, it will write files to the application's current working directory by default.

If you're running the application from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, the current working directory is typically the bin/Debug/netcoreappX.X or bin/Release/netcoreappX.X directory inside the project directory, where X.X is your target framework version.

If you're running the compiled .exe directly, the current working directory will be the directory where the .exe file resides.

The code snippet:

csharp
Copy code
using (var writer = new StreamWriter("titles.csv"))
{
    var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    csv.WriteRecords(titles);
}
This should create the titles.csv file in the current working directory as described above. If the file is not appearing there, it could be due to an issue with the file writing operation itself, or the program may not have permissions to write to that directory.

If no exceptions are being thrown and the files are not being generated in the expected location, please ensure that your application has the necessary file write permissions.
